# Hera Logging Log4J Extension

This is an Hera Logging Framework extension in order to use Log4J as the underlying logging mechanism. With this extension you can use any version of Log4J.

## Getting Started

The hera-logging-log4j-ext.jar contains all the classes and configuration files required to enable this extension. This jar contains `hera-logging.properties' and
a basic `log4j2.properties`, which you should remove if you already have defined a lo4j configuration file.

### Using Hera Logging Framework


#### Setup
   You need to include the hera-logging.jar and hera-logging-log4j-ext.jar in the classpath.

#### Usage

Same as defined in Hera Logging Framework
